# 🎯 Project 11: HTML Video 🥁

What we want for our video player is just some simple functionalities: play, pause, skip, volume and playback controls. Now, some of you may feel it is hard because for some tasks, like volume or playback, you do not know how to implement the functionalities. 

It's very simple. In video element, we have many attributes and functions. For example, the play() function from the video element can be used to play the video, and the currentTime or duration can be used to track the video's progress. Putting 'keyup' events on top and now you can allow user to interacts with the video players.

Result:
