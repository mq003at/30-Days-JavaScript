# 🎯 Day 9: Project 9 - Dev Tool Tricks 🥁

Our goal for this project is to debug our codes by turning on Break On and Force Break. When debugging, we can use many console commands to write information in our logs. The commands we are using today are warn(), error(), info() and group(). Alongside those commands, we also use table() to turn our arrays into table format, time() to find the duration our requests take and assert() for testing.
