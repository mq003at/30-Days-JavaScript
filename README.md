# 🎯 Day 1: Project - The JS Drum Kit 🥁

Today, I built a virtual drum kit! It's a simple yet fun project where pressing the keys (A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K, L) triggers different drum sounds. The magic happens with JavaScript listening for key presses, matching them to the corresponding drum elements, and playing the sounds. Ready to make some noise?
