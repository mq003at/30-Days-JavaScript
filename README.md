# 🎯 Day 8: Project 8 - HTML Canvas 🥁
Our goal for today is to add HTML Canvas to our website, so when the user clicks and drags the mouse on the screen, they can draw directly on it. The brush in the canvas will have their width and color changed using HSL. 

I am very excited about today's project since I have never used canvas in modern coding or school. Learning new things is always a good experience.
