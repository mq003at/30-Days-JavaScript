# üéØ Project 10: Shift for Checkboxes ü•Å

Our main focus for today is to make multiple checkboxes and let them automatically checked when user hold the Shift button. It's just like how you select folders on Windows, you click on one folder, hold Shift, and click the end folder to select multiple of them at once. This project is like that, but instead of folders, you deal with checkbox this time.

Now, how to implement this? Very simple. If you remember from our previous projects, we know that querySelectorAll() will puts all of our elements into an array. Next, by passing the index of the current checked checkbox and make a variable to store the previous one, we can know the starting checkbox and the ending checkbox of the list of boxes we need to check.
