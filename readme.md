# Project 30: WhackAMole

So, this is our final project of our challenge. To celebrate this, we are going to make a game that will ultilized setTimeout() and user's mouse control. This is a very good project to demonstrate how good JS is in making games, so let's strap on!

First, since we need to click on a mole to whack it, we will give eventListeners to all the holes on the webpage. Then, we will have 2 random generators to decide which hole and which time will the mole appear, one function to make the mole shows up (by adding class 'up' to it) and one function to whack it (if there is 'up', remove it).

At the end, there is not much to say about this project, since it's a very simple game, like Tic-tac-toe, which could be useful to teach students how to code with Javascript in universities.
