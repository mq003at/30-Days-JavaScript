# 🎯 Project 28: Video Controller 🥁

Today we will have another easy project. This time, we will combine what we learned about offset and use it to learn more about the currentElement variable to make an element changed by scrolling. 

By having the location of our current mouse minus the location of the element, we can get our current mouse's location compared to the element, and if we convert it into %, we can use it to make an element scollable, like how volume or playback button works. At any case, this project will be very easy if you have been through the Video maker project earlier.
