# 🎯 Project 29: Countdown Timer 🥁

The goal for today's project is to create a basic timer that can sound an alarm for us. Since setTimeout's time will be frozen when the user interacts with the webpage, we have to use setInterval instead.  Furthermore, we can use clearInterval() to clear all the current ongoing timeout at the moment so that the new countdown could run.
