# 🎯 Project 27: Click and Drag 🥁

Now we are nearly at the end so let's come to face with some harder problem. Today's topic will be Click and Drag. The goal is that we have a very big element, and you can click or touch the screen to drag the element across the screen. How can you implement this?

For the solution, we need 2 steps. First, we need to check if the user is scrolling or not, and by using eventListener 'mouseup', 'mousemove' and 'mouseleave', we can determine that behavior. Then, we use .scrollLeft property to move the element across the screen, and our objective will be finished.
